            India's Forest
        </h1>
        <p>
            India is not only famous for its diverse wildlife, architectural marvels and culture, but also for its dense
            and vast forest cover. Indian climate befits the variety of flora and fauna.

            Forest is the second largest land use in India next to agriculture. The forest cover of India is assessed as
            67.83 million hectares which constitute 20.64 per cent of the country's geographical area, ranging from the
            Himalayan Temperate to Dry Zone forests. The National Forest Policy stipulates that one-third of area should
            be under forest or tree cover. Being a mega-bio diversity country, the nation possesses high level of
            endemism.
